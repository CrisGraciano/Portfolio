# Portfolio
Portfolio Websiite completed for assignment 2. I would like to improve still do not have much practice with flexbox so any feedback is greatly appreciated. 
I cannot upload a screenshot of the website for some reason. Trying to figure it out and will update as I resolve the issue.


Update website is live I believe. Now I am having trouble with the second project website. 
Git hub is showing website is being made.
